# karger_stein

Implementation of Karger's randomized min-cut algorithms using union-find datastructure. Input files are edgelists of undirected, unweighted, zero-indexed graphs. 


"make main" compiles the program. Running ./main performs both algorithms 
on a full graph with 300 nodes and outputs runtime data for both algorithms. Input graph path can be changed inside main function.
